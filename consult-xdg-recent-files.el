;;; Commentary:
;; just a slightly cleaned up version of
;; https://github.com/minad/consult/wiki#including-file-recently-used-by-other-programs
;; If you find yourself using other programs with Emacs, it can be helpful to include files used by other programs in the candidate lists of commands like consult-recent-file and consult-buffer. That way, you never have any mental hiccups when trying to open files in Emacs that you recently opened in a different program. Instead, you simply use the same interface with which you are already familiar.
;;
;; The way to access this information is generally specific to each system. Please update this section for other systems, if you find this feature useful.
;;
;; In Linux (or, more specifically, on systems that comply with the XDG specification), these files are listed in the file recently-used.xbel, which is found in the directory ~/.local/share or the location described by the environment variable XDG_DATA_HOME.
;;
;; We can access the data in this file using libraries built-in with Emacs, namely url-util.el, dom.el, and one of xml.c or xml.el.

;;;; Usage

;; Example: using the "mixed" source in `consult-buffer':
